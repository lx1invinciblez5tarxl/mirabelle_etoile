# mirabelle_etoile

Hi! If you're seeing this, this is just my little portfolio site. It's a simple little static site I decided to make after using Wordpress, which I felt wasn't the best site for what I wanted to do considering I also had to pay for it. It's FAR from perfect and I'm sure there are some values I've inputted that weren't necessary. The site is structured primarily for desktop and so far has only been tested with Chrome and Edge, so feel free to also take this at least as a base to make it user-friendly for mobile, tablets, and all other browsers.

I've done my best to at least organize important parts of the page as best as possible as it's helped me keep track of where everything is placed. Hopefully it's a little helpful for you as well.
