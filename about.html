<h3>The Cute Little Artist</h3>

<para>       
<h4>Hello, and welcome to my portfolio site! </h4>  
    
<p>I'm just another aspiring digital and graphic artist, looking for some exciting artwork to give to someone to cherish! Sorry for the big block of text! Skip it if it's a bore, but take the time to look further down this page for a better idea of my skills.</p>   
    
<p>I studied under the game design major and visual arts minor to explore my interests in everything related to art. Game art, fine arts, digital arts, 2D and 3D animation, graphic and web design, I've dabbled in them all. I've worked solo in projects and collaborated with classmates in others. After all those years in college, I've settled primarily on honing my digital and graphic art, though may consider making 2D game assets in the future. </p>
    
<p>While my main art style is cute, I have done other projects of various themes as well. I'm happy to try other styles to the best of my ability. I hope to expand my skills further!</p>
